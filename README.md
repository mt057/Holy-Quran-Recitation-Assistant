# Holy Quran Recitation Assistant
<p align="justify">
The Holy Quran is the most sacred book for Muslims all over the world and many people learn it by heart. A person who learns the Holy Quran by heart is called a hafiz. During the period of learning the Holy Quran by heart, one can face many difficulties, like hafiz always needs someone who can listen to their recitation and point out the mistakes. But, sometimes no one is available for them to do this and there is a high probability that they won’t find out their mistakes. To assist a hafiz in such cases, we need an application (Holy Quran Recitation Assistant) that can do the work as a listener and can tell if the reciter is wrong. Thus, we developed a system using speech recognition to solve this problem. It works in two steps.  

1- The recited voice is converted to text.

2- The generated text in step 1 is compared to the actual Arabic text of the Holy Quran. If the generated text is the same as that of the actual Qur’anic text, it is supposed that the reciter is reciting correctly. Otherwise, it is assumed that the reciter has made a mistake and the Qur’anic listener will notify the reciter. Our system works in the same way as a human Qur’anic listener does in Tarawih prayers. Our system can be used in mosques and other religious institutes so that reciters can minimize their mistakes.
